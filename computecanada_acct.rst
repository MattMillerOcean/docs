`Compute Canada`_ is the national network of shared advanced research computing (ARC) and storage that we use for most of our ocean model calculations.
`WestGrid`_ is the regional organization that coordinates the western Canadian universities partnership with Compute Canada.

To access Compute Canada and WestGrid compute clusters and storage you need to register a Compute Canada account at https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/account_application.
To do so you will need an :kbd:`eoas.ubc.ca` email address,
and Susan's Compute Canada CCRI code.

   When prompted to select an institution, choose :kbd:`WestGrid: University of British Columbia`.
