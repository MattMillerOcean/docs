Conda Package and Environment Manager
*************************************

We use `conda`_ software packages,
dependencies,
and environments.
:program:`conda` is part of the excellent `Anaconda data science toolkit`_,
but we have found that using :program:`conda` and explicitly managing software environments is more robust over time than using Anaconda.

.. _InstallingMiniconda:

Installing Miniconda
====================

.. important:: 
    *Do not* install Miniconda or Anaconda on the Compute Canada HPC clusters or other HPC systems!
    It will almost certainly conflict with the HPC-optimized software environments on those system.
    If you need to install Python packages on an HPC system,
    please contact Doug for advice.

`Miniconda`_ is a minimal installer for conda.
It installs the :program:`conda` package and environment manager tool,
a recent version of Python, the packages that :program:`conda` depends on, 
and a small number of other packages that are essential for creating and managing software environments.

.. _Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

The installers for Miniconda are linked on the `Miniconda`_ page.
You can download them from there,
and that is what you should do if you are working on Windows.
But for Linux and MacOS you'll be working with :program:`conda` on the command-line in terminals sessions,
so you might as well get started that way by using :program:`wget` to download the installer script into your home directory.
On Linux use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

On MacOS use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

The installation instructions are linked from https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation.
In short:

#. Run the installer script via :program:`bash`:

   On Linux use:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

   On MacOS use:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

   Follow the prompts on the screen.
   Accept the defaults offered for all of the settings

#. To make the changes take effect,
   close and then re-open your terminal window.

#. Test your installation. In your terminal window,
   run the command :command:`conda list`.
   A list of installed packages appears if it has been installed correctly;
   it looks something like:

   .. code-block:: text

        # packages in environment at /home/dlatorne/miniconda3:

.. _condaConfiguration:

:program:`conda` Configuration
==============================

:program:`conda` uses configuration settings in your :file:`$HOME/.condarc` file to supplement its default configuration.
You need to set up this configuration on each machine that you use :program:`conda` on;
i.e. on your laptop,
and on the Waterhole workstation that you use
(which will cover all of the Waterhole/Ocean machines).

The :command:`conda config` command is how you interact with the :file:`$HOME/.condarc` file.
Start by telling :program:`conda` to use the `conda-forge`_ channel as its preferred channel to find packages:

.. _conda-forge: https://conda-forge.org/

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda config --prepend channels conda-forge

Also do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda config --prepend envs_dirs $HOME/conda_envs/
    $ mkdir $HOME/conda_envs/

The first of those lines tells :program:`conda` that you want to put your environments in a directory called :file:`$HOME/conda_envs/`.
The second line creates that directory.
Storing environment directory trees outside of the :file:`$HOME/miniconda3/` directory created by the installer means that if you need to re-install Miniconda you can do so without destroying all of your environments.

If you want to see all of the :program:`conda` configuration settings
(both the defaults,
and the supplements from your :file:`$HOME/.condarc` file,
you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda config --show

There are many,
many things that you can configure in :program:`conda`.
If you want to see all of the gory details,
please see the `conda config docs`_.
